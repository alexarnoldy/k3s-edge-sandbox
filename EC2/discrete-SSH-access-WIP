This module allows locking down SSH access from a subnet or single IP address.

Before running terraform apply, run these commands to allow SSH access from only this system to the created resources:

myip="$(dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com)"
export TF_VAR_my_public_ip=\'[\"${myip}/32\"]\'
export $(env | grep TF_VAR_my_public_ip)
